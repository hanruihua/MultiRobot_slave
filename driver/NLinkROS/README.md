# NLink ROS Package

The ROS driver package is developed based on the NLink of Nooploop protocol series written in C++, and there are no other dependency libraries except ROS.

Mainly includes the following parts:

- [Serial library](https://github.com/wjwwood/serial): A cross-platform library for interfacing with rs-232 serial like ports written in C++
- General protocol parsing library: Data can be directly inputted into the parsing interface, protocol frame splicing and verification will be completed automatically, only need to inherit our protocol class to obtain parsing support.
- Product support (non Nooploop product users can also use them as examples)
  - LinkTrack: LinkTrack is a powerful local positioning system with PNTC (location, navigation, timing, communication) based on UWB(Ultra-wide Bandwidth) technology. Supporting 1-D, 2-D, 3-D positioning, 1-D, 2-D positioning accuracy is 10cm, 3-D typical positioning accuracy is 30cm; When choose a 50Hz refresh frequency, it supports 40 Tags and 8 anchors;Supporting distributed ranging and data transmission, is easy to be used for robots formation without geographical restrictions; supporting pure data transmission mode, with 3Mbps. 
  - TOFSense: TOFSense is a laser ranging sensor based on TOF(Time of Flight) technology. The ranging range is 1 cm~5 m, the range resolution is 1 mm, and the data update frequency is 10 Hz. Adjustable FOV, maximum view angle is 27 degrees; Support UART and CAN communication; Support constant frequency output or query it by yourself; Support multi-sensor cascade ranging.

## Getting started

Build:

```
catkin_make

source devel/setup.bash
```

Run(For LinkTrack):

```
rosrun nlink linktrack_publisher /dev/ttyUSB0 921600
```

Run(For TOFSense):

```
rosrun nlink tofsense_publisher /dev/ttyUSB0 921600
```

Notice: please use port name and baud rate of your device instead.

Known issue

- Run failed, show "Unhandled Exception: IO Exception (13): Permission denied, file ... ", permission needs to be changed.

Edit file

```
sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/70-ttyusb.rules
```

append

```
KERNEL=="ttyUSB[0-9]*",MODE="0666"
```

Then replug the device, try again.
